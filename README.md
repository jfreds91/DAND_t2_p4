Final Tableau visualization is here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/jesse6313#!/vizhome/DAND_T2_P4_final_2/Dashboard2?publish=yes

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to create a public Tableau dashboard analyzing aircraft data. I chose to analyze flight data from 2008, and to try to show common delays, and the "best" times to plan your departure to minimize delays.

## Files
**Rough_Analysis:** this file shows contains all of the data cleaning I did in order to properly analyze the available data before processing it in Tableau

**DAND_T2_P4_Writeup.ipynb:** this file details all of the processing and analysis I performed, and is only text fields. It is duplicated in html format in the .html file of the same name

## Results / Instructions
My analysis will not be repeatable from the files in this repository because of storage restrictions on Github. However, the results of my work are showcased in the public Tableau dashboard at the top of this readme file. Please read through the DAND_T2_P4_Writeup files for a detailed description of the work that went into the dashboard.
